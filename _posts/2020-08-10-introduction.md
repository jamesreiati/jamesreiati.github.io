# About Me #
I'm James. I have spent the last 8 years of my life building various solutions in C#. These mostly consisted of web services in .NET and Unity projects.

# About This Site #
Over the past three projects I've built up a toolkit of useful patterns and objects that have kept my projects clean and easy to understand. None of the objects are big enough for their own repository, and patterns aren't something that people usually put into a repository. A blog feels like the most appropriate place to put all of them. By forcing myself to document them I'll have a better understanding of them. If I'm documenting them anyway, why not share?

But I don't want to limit myself too strictly. If you're reading this, know that this what the original goal of the blog was. I wonder if I kept on track...
