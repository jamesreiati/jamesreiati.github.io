# About Me #
I have spent the last 8 years of my life building various solutions in C#. These mostly consisted of web services in .NET and Unity projects.

# About This Site #
I've been wanting to start learning Godot for a while, so I'm starting now. I hope to bring useful patterns and helpful insight from the C# world into the Godot world. Hopefully by sharing these insights, I can save you time on your projects. Although I'll be discovering what this site looks like as I post to it, I expect you'll find short posts on patterns, tricks, and tips.
