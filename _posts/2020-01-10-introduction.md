# About Me #
I have spent the last 8 years of my life primarly programming various types of solutions in C#.

# About This Site #
I've been wanting to start learning Godot for a while, but I'm starting now. I hope to bring useful patterns and helpful insight from the C# world into the Godot world. I want to share these insights on this site. Although I'll be discovering this site as I post to it, I expect you'll find patterns, tricks, tips, and probably and peek into my Godot project.
